=== Primitive Classes ===   
- no internal mem alloc, can be initialized without constr/destr/copy op

GsBox, GsCamera, GsVec, GsVec2, GsQuat, GsColor, GsEvent, GsLight, GsLoc, GsQuat
GsMat, GsMaterial, GsLine, GsPlane, GsPrimitive, GsRandom, GsTime, GsTimer
GsTrackball, GsVal
GsShared

=== Generic Classes ===   
- manage mem, need copy operator, copy constr etc.

 GsString, GsVar, GsVars, GsMatn
 *GsInput, *GsOutput
 *GsPolygon (derives GsArray), GsString (derives GsArray)
 (do not act as a container)

=== Fast Containers ===
- contr/destr/copy operator of user data are not called
- have to be used with primitive classes or with pointers
 GsArray, GsBuffer, GsQueue, GsDeque, GsHeap, GsGrid
*all need PointerVersion: GsTablePtr<X> and ref version: GsTableRef<X>

=== Pointer Containers ===
- Gs classes ending with Pt
- handle new/delete mem alloc, protected inheritance from FastContainer

GsArrayPt: needs to use private or protected inheritance
GsTable: allow user-defined hash function
*GsSet (based on user pointers)

=== Managed Container ===
- no copy constructor (no return by function)
- uses another class to manage user data allocation, copy, etc
 GsGraph, GsList, 
 *GsManager, GsManagerBase are shared

=== Referencing Container ===
- container for shareable elements, which derive from GsShareable
- will use object pointers and methods ref/unref 
- Example: GsArrayRef
